# Special settings:
#   - 'same': use the test split of the training data (i.e. clean data)
#   - 'base': use the validation data of the base run (which may include e.g. some
#             backdoor data)
# You can also set val_data to some actual data configuration
# or to an empty dictionary to disable validation.
